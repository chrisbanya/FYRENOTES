FYRENOTES

This is a simple and dynamic notes application built with React and Material UI. Phew! So initially, i used JSON server for data management - setting & fetching notes, including user authenication, but later upgraded it to include Firebase Authentication and Firestore for enhanced security and real-time data handling. Honestly this change was due to the fact JSON server can't be deployed to vercel. In hindsight, i dont regret this very decision because i believe i learned a lot and also grew a lot as a developer! so back to the project below are it's KEY featuresüòÅ

Features
User authentication with Firebase

Real-time database with Firestore

Responsive UI with Material UI

CRUD operations for managing notes
